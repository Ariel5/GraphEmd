# Graph Encoder Embedding

Implement the Graph Encoder Embedding from:

**C. Shen and Q. Wang and C. E. Priebe, "Graph Encoder Embedding", 2021.**


The main functions are in the **GraphEmd/Main** folder, implemented in Matlab / R / Python. All other folders and function are for evaluation purpose. 

Currently the Matlab script has full functionality; the R script does not support clustering yet (no known label); the Python scripts does not support edgelist input nor clustering yet.

Planned feature: bring R and Python version up-to-date; add semi-supervised learning.
