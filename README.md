# Graph Encoder Embedding

Implement the Graph Encoder Embedding from:
C. Shen and Q. Wang and C. E. Priebe, "Graph Encoder Embedding", 2021. 


The main function is in the main folder, implemented in Matlab / R / Python. All other folders and function are for evaluation purpose. 


Currently Matlab script has full functions; the R script does not do clustering yet (no known label); the Python scripts does not support edgelist nor clustering yet.


Planned feature: bring R and Python version up-to-date; add semi-supervised learning.
