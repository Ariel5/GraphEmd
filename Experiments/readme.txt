Each folder consists of simulated and real data experiments using GraphEncoder.

For this paper: 
Cencheng Shen, Qizhe Wang, Carey E Priebe, "Grah Encoder Embedding", submitted, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13098.pdf
Most experiments are carried out in /Matlab. 
Here we provide descriptions for some core scripts:
1. GraphEncoderEvaluate.m: the classification comparison script.
2. simClassification.m: use simulated data and load real data for classification evaluation.
3. GraphClusteringEvaluate.m: the clustering comparison.
4. simClustering.m: use simulated data and load real data for clustering evaluation.
5. simGenerate.m: generate simulated data.
6. generatePlotAEE.m: the function that plots all figures in the paper. 

Some data and figures are already generated within the /Matlab folder. 
Other scripts are mostly auxiliary functions and experimental trials.
Please open an issue if any of the code is obsolete and does not run.
